#### this homework was abit difficult coz parsing the multiple object and and storing value was challenging.
 ## I tried all the methods that I learned and available.
 hard coding the html value or creating from an object array.
 and finallly I created from object array gave value id(attribute)
 and one extra elemnt identity to just compare the current hour with that.
